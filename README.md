# EducationLevelsInBostonNeighborhoods
This is a visualization and report of education levels across the Boston neighborhoods in search of correlation between median household income and education levels.
This was a homework assignment from a course called Bostonography which combines social issues with data science and is focused around Boston-related datasets. The assignment was to tell a story about Boston demographics using data from the American Community Survey.

HTML and PDF versions of my report have been included in this repository.
ACS_1216_TRACT.csv is data from American Community Survey
Tracts_Boston_2010_BARI.csv is data collected and organized by BARI (Boston Area Research Initiative)

If you wish to download and run visualizing_education_across_boston.Rmd, be sure that both data sets (.csv files) are in the same path as the Rmd file.
